      <p class="cs-text">
        AIMAI Auto Electronic Solutions was founded by Isaiah D. Alexander, a
        passionate and self-taught technician from Inkster, Michigan. With
        hands-on experience dating back to childhood and formal training from
        ITT Technical Institute, Isaiah turned a lifelong fascination with
        electronics into a thriving mobile installation business. After
        overcoming personal setbacks, he launched AIMAI in 2022 and has since
        serviced thousands of vehicles and heavy equipment—from sedans and
        semi-trucks to generators and farm machinery.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Backed by MECP certifications and years of real-world problem solving,
        Isaiah now leads installations for national brands and trains the next
        generation of technicians. His mission: engineer trust, restore
        confidence, and bring intelligent solutions to anything with a battery
        and motor.

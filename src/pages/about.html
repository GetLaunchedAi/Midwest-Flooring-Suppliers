         My name is Isaiah D. Alexander, born on the memorable day of 7/7. I’m a 36-year-old father of two, a proud native of Inkster, Michigan, and the middle child of three boys raised by a strong single mother. From an early age, responsibility became second nature. By age 10, I was doing construction work with a neighbor, and by 11, I was painting homes and even built my own basement bedroom—still standing today as a symbol of my determination and hands-on spirit.

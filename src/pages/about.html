      <p class="cs-text">
        AIMAI Auto Electronic Solutions was founded by Isaiah D. Alexander, a
        passionate and self-taught technician from Inkster, Michigan. With early
        hands-on experience and formal education from ITT Technical Institute,
        Isaiah transformed his lifelong passion for electronics into a
        successful mobile installation business. After facing and overcoming
        adversity, he officially launched AIMAI in 2022 and has since serviced
        thousands of vehicles and heavy equipment—from daily drivers and
        commercial fleets to generators and agricultural machinery.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Supported by MECP certifications and extensive field experience, Isaiah
        now leads installations for national brands and mentors the next wave of
        technicians. His mission: engineer trust, restore confidence, and
        deliver intelligent solutions for anything powered by a battery and
        motor.

          experience as a kid to earning technical certifications and leading
          national installs, I’ve built this business to deliver precision,
          reliability, and innovation to every job.
